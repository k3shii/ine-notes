# Post Exploitation

## [Post-Exploitation](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Post\_Exploitation) Introduction <a href="#post-exploitation-introduction" id="post-exploitation-introduction"></a>

üóíÔ∏è **Post-Exploitation** is the final phase of interaction with a target during a pentest. Using various attacking techniques, the pentester determines the value of the compromised system and keeps control of it for future usage, depending on the kind of access and the stealthiness he must have.

It is _what the pentester does after the initial foothold_ and the techniques depends on the target characteristics (operating system, infrastructure).

* The techniques must follow the _**Rules of Engagement**_ agreed upon with the client **before the penetration test**, based on the company infrastructure and services.

> ‚ùó**Necessary permissions are required to conduct post-exploitation techniques like modifying services, system configuration, logs deletion, perform privilege escalation.**

### Methodology <a href="#methodology" id="methodology"></a>

1. Local Enumeration

> * Enumerating System Information
> * Enumerating Users And Groups
> * Enumerating Network Information
> * Enumerating Services
> * Automating Local Enumeration

2. Transferring Files

> * Setting Up A Web Server With Python
> * Transferring Files To Windows Targets
> * Transferring Files To Linux Targets

3. Upgrading Shells

> * Upgrading Command Shells To Meterpreter
> * Spawning TTY Shells

4. Privilege Escalation

> * Identifying PrivEsc Vulns
> * Windows PrivEsc
> * Linux PrivEsc

5. Persistence

> * Setting Up Persistence On Windows
> * Setting Up Persistence On Linux

6. Dumping & Cracking Hashes

> * Dumping & Cracking Windows Hashes
> * Dumping & Cracking Linux Hashes

7. Pivoting

> * Internal Network Recon
> * Pivoting

8. Clearing Tracks

> * Clearing your Tracks On Windows & Linux

_The post-exploitation process repeats itself after pivoting to another new target._
