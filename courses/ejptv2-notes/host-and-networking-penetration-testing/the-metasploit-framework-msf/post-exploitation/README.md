# Post Exploitation

## [Post Exploitation](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/msf-post-exploitation/) with MSF <a href="#post-exploitation-with-msf" id="post-exploitation-with-msf"></a>

🗒️ **Post Exploitation** is the process of gaining further information or access to the target's internal network, after the initial exploitation phase, using various techniques like:

* **local enumeration**
* [**privilege escalation**](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/privilege-escalation/)
* **maintaining persistent access**
* [**pivoting**](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/pivoting/)
* **dumping hashes**
* **covering tracks**

There are many post exploitation modules provided by the MSF.

🗒️ **Persistence** consists of techniques used by adversaries _to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, or other interruptions_.

🗒️ [**Keylogging**](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/keylogging/) is the action of (secretly) _recording/capturing the keystrokes entered on a target system_.

🗒️ **Pivoting** is a post exploitation technique of using a compromised host, a **`foothold`** / **`plant`**, to attack other systems on its private internal network.

### Fundamentals - [Meterpreter](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/about-meterpreter/) <a href="#fundamentals-meterpreter" id="fundamentals-meterpreter"></a>

* Facilitates the execution of system commands, file system navigation, keylogging
* Load custom scripts and plugins dynamically
* 📌 **MSF has various types of `Meterpreter` payloads based on the target environment**

> 🔬 Check the [Meterpreter Labs](meterpreter-msf.md) for various `Meterpreter` commands and techniques examples and how to upgrade shells to Meterpreter sessions.

## Windows PE Modules <a href="#windows-pe-modules" id="windows-pe-modules"></a>

Windows post exploitation MSF modules can be used to:

* Enumerate user privileges, logged-on users, installed programs, antiviruses, computers connected to a domain, installed patches and shares
* VM check

🗒️ **Windows Event Logs**, accessed via the `Event Viewer` on Windows, are categorized into:

* `Application logs` - apps startups, crashes, etc
* `System logs` - system startups, reboots, etc
* `Security logs` - password changes, authentication failures/success, etc

Clearing event logs is an important part of the system assessment.

## Linux PE Modules <a href="#linux-pe-modules" id="linux-pe-modules"></a>

Linux post exploitation MSF modules can be used to:

* Enumerate system configuration, environment variables, network configuration, user's history
* VM check
