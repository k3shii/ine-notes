# Post Exploitation

## [Post Exploitation](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/msf-post-exploitation/) with MSF <a href="#post-exploitation-with-msf" id="post-exploitation-with-msf"></a>

🗒️ **Post Exploitation** is the process of gaining further information or access to the target's internal network, after the initial exploitation phase, using various techniques like:

* **local enumeration**
* [**privilege escalation**](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/privilege-escalation/)
* **maintaining persistent access**
* [**pivoting**](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/pivoting/)
* **dumping hashes**
* **covering tracks**

There are many post exploitation modules provided by the MSF.

🗒️ **Persistence** consists of techniques used by adversaries _to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, or other interruptions_.

🗒️ [**Keylogging**](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/keylogging/) is the action of (secretly) _recording/capturing the keystrokes entered on a target system_.

🗒️ **Pivoting** is a post exploitation technique of using a compromised host, a **`foothold`** / **`plant`**, to attack other systems on its private internal network.
