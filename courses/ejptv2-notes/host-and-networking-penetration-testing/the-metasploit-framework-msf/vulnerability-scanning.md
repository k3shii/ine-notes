* Useful in the **Exploitation** phase of the pentest

ðŸ”¬ [Metasploitable3](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3) lab environment will be used for the vulnerability scanning demonstration.

* **Metasploitable3** is a vulnerable virtual machine developed by Rapid7, intended to be used as a vulnerable target for testing exploits with Metasploit.

> ðŸ”¬ You can find my lab installation & configuration with Vagrant at [this page](https://blog.syselement.com/home/home-lab/redteam/metasploitable3), _set up for educational purposes_.

* Kali Linux attacker machine must be configured with **the same local network** of the Metasploitable3 VMs.
