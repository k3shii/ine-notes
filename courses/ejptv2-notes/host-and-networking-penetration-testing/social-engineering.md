üóíÔ∏è **Social engineering** is a type of cyber attack that exploits human psychology to gain access to sensitive information or systems. Instead of using technical exploits to hack into a system, social engineers manipulate people into giving up confidential information (_gather information_) or performing actions that compromise security (_gain access_).

The success of social engineering attacks relies on the attacker's ability to **create a convincing scenario** that triggers an _emotional response, such as curiosity, fear, or urgency, in the victim_.

Social engineering through physical security is an effective tactic to gain **physical access** to a restricted building or office area.

Here are some examples of manipulating attacks:

* Phishing, Vishing, Smishing
* Impersonation
* [Pretexting](https://github.com/L4bF0x/PhishingPretexts)
* Emotional pull, Urgency
* Quid pro quo, Blackmail
* Watering hole

> ‚ùó **It's important to stay vigilant against phishing attacks and be wary of any unsolicited messages asking for personal or sensitive information.**

## Phishing <a href="#phishing" id="phishing"></a>

üóíÔ∏è **Phishing** is the most common form of social engineering attack. Attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to be from a reputable source, such as a bank or social media site, to trick the victim into revealing their login credentials, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information.

* **`e.g.`** Emails with malicious links and/or attachments

Common types of phishing attacks are:

* `Spear Phishing` - _targeted attack where the attacker researches and personalizes the message to increase the likelihood of success_
* `Whaling` - _targets high-profile individuals_, such as executives or celebrities, who have access to sensitive information or financial resources
* `Smishing` - phishing attack that _uses SMS text messages to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware_
* `Vishing` - phishing attack that uses _voice communication, such as a phone call, to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information_
* `Baiting` - _leaving a physical device, such as a USB drive, in a public place for the victim to pick it up and plug it into their computer, unintentionally downloading malware, keylogger, backdoor_

Getting people's trust is a big part of a phishing attack and can be done through different approaches like redirecting web traffic maliciously, targeting a trusted site and use it against the victim (**watering hole**), compromise business email (**BEC**), spoofing and impersonation.

* Create a `Campaign` - give the campaign a name, select the type of phishing campaign to create (such as credential harvesting or malicious attachment), and specify the targets and email template

<figure><img src="https://blog.syselement.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1996978447-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FlhjuckuLbvBn36EoFL7P%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-b2f104f99656c0ce85dff118f7f8eb635af69484%252Fimage-20230430220159433.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&#x26;width=768&#x26;dpr=4&#x26;quality=100&#x26;sign=283a6223&#x26;sv=1" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* `Launch the campaign` - Gophish will automatically send the phishing emails to the target list and track who clicked on the link and submitted data
* Analyze the results provided by Gophish as detailed metrics on email opens, link clicks and successful credential submissions.

### Solution

**Step 1:** Open the lab link to access the Windows GUI instance

This lab environment will provide you with access to a pre-configured Windows system that has all the required tools installed.

**Step 2:** Starting the Gophish server

To begin with, you will need to startup the Gophish server, this can be done by double clicking on the **gophish.exe** shortcut on the desktop of the Windows system you have been provided access to as shown in the following screenshot.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As shown in the following screenshot, once the Gophish server is started up you will be provided with a command prompt session that will display the current working state of the Gophish server in addition to the local port it is listening on.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this case, the Gophish server is listening on port **https://127.0.0.1:3333**.

You can access the Gophish admin panel by navigating to the aforementioned address in a web browser like Firefox.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The admin panel does not have a valid SSL certificate, as a result, you will need to click on the advanced button and click on "accept the risk and continue" as shown in the following screenshot.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/4.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will now be prompted with the Gophish admin panel authentication form, you can login with the following credentials: **admin:phishingpasswd**.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/5.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After logging in successfully, you will be redirected to the Gophish dashboard.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/8.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will bring up the sending profile customization prompt where you can specify different criteria based on your requirements, in this case, we will use the following configuration for the sending profile:

1. Name: red
2. From: info [**support@demo.ine.local**](mailto:support@demo.ine.local)
3. Host: localhost:25
4. Username: red@demo.ine.local
5. Password: penetrationtesting

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/9.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After configuring the sending profile accordingly, we can test the configuration by clicking on the **Send Test Email** button as shown in the following screenshot.

This will prompt you to specify the details of the recipient, in this case we will be sending the test email to **victim@demo.ine.local** whose mailbox has already been configured in Thunderbird.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/11.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To verify that the test email was sent successfully, we can open up the Thunderbird email client installed and configured on the Windows system. As shown in the following screenshot, the test email was sent and received successfully thus confirming that the sending profile is functional.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/12.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can now save the sending profile.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/13.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 4:** Setting up a Gophish landing page

In order for us to setup a successful phishing campaign, we will need to setup a landing page where target users will be directed to for credential harvesting.

To begin with, we can click on the **Landing Pages** menu item on the side menu of the dashboard as shown in the following screenshot.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/14.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can then create a new landing page by clicking on the **New Page** button as highlighted in the preceding screenshot.

This will bring up the landing page customization prompt, where we can specify the site we would like to emulate or clone for the purpose of the phishing campaign.

In this case, we will be using a custom landing page being hosted on the **localhost:8080**.

As shown in the following screenshot, we can specify the landing page name and click on the **Import Site** button to import the pre-existing landing page.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/15.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will prompt you to specify the URL of the site you would like to import, as shown in the following screenshot, we will specify the URL **http://localhost:8080**, after which, you can click on import.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/16.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After importing the site, you will be able to modify the appearance of the site and the data that is collected.

In this case, we will be capturing all submitted data and will be redirecting users to the landing page hosted on **localhost:8080**.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/17.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After configuring the landing page, we can save the page by clicking on the **Save Page** button as shown in the preceding screenshot.

**Step 5:** Setting up a Gophish email template

Now that we have setup the sending profile and landing page, we can move on to the next step which involves setting up the email template for this phishing campaign.

To begin with, we can create a new email template by clicking on the **Email Templates** menu item on the sidebar. You will then need to click on the **New Template** button as shown in the following screenshot.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/18.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

An email template called **Password Reset Email.txt** has been provided to you in the lab environment on the Desktop of the Windows system as shown in the following screenshot.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/19.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will need to copy the content of the email template as we will be using it for our phishing campaign.

We can now setup the new Gophish email template. As shown in the following screenshot, paste the content of the email template you copied previously in the body section of the email template.

<figure><img src="https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/20.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
