# Enumeration

A **server** is a computer program or device that provides a **service** to another computer program and its user, also known as the **client**. It accepts and responds to request made over a network. The term _server_ can refer to a physical machine, a virtual machine or to software performing server services.

It can run various operating systems like Windows Server, Linux Server, macOS Server.

Servers need to be accessed remotely by multiple clients, so the server must _open_ and accept connections on the listening _port_ of the service.

Open port service bugs and vulnerabilities could expose the entire server to attackers.
