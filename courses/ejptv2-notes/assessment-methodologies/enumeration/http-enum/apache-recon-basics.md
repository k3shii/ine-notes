# Apache Recon: Basics

### Overview

> In this challenge we will look at the basics of Apache server reconnaissance. Please start the lab and answer the following questions:
>
> **Questions**
>
> 1. Which web server software is running on the target server and also find out the version using nmap.
> 2. Which web server software is running on the target server and also find out the version using suitable metasploit module.
> 3. Check what web app is hosted on the web server using curl command.
> 4. Check what web app is hosted on the web server using wget command.
> 5. Check what web app is hosted on the web server using browsh CLI based browser.
> 6. Check what web app is hosted on the web server using lynx CLI based browser.
> 7. Perform bruteforce on webserver directories and list the names of directories found. Use brute\_dirs metasploit module.
> 8. Use the directory buster (dirb) with tool/usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/directory.txt dictionary to check if any directory is present in the root folder of the web server. List the names of found directories.
> 9. Which bot is specifically banned from accessing a specific directory?
>

> * This lab is dedicated to you! No other users are on this network :)
> * Once you start the lab, you will have access to a root terminal of a Kali instance
> * Your Kali has an interface with IP address 192.X.Y.Z. Run "ip addr" to know the values of X and Y.
> * The Target machine should be located at the IP address 192.X.Y.3.
> * Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.X.Y.1
