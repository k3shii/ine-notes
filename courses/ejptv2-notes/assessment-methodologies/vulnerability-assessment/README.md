# Vulnerability Assessment

## Vulnerabilities <a href="#vulnerabilities" id="vulnerabilities"></a>

üóíÔ∏è A **vulnerability** is _a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source._ When exploited, it results in a negative impact to `confidentiality`, `integrity` or `availability`.

* **`Physical layer`** - `e.g.` people, physical controls, vaults, door locks, gates, fences, cameras, badge readers, etc. There can be vulnerabilities in those as well, exploited through social engineering techniques or hardware exploitation. for physical access.
* Vulnerabilities on a computer comes from the operating system, systems and installed services, found by _DevSec engineers, Security researchers, Pentesters, Software developers, Users._
* [**NVD** (**N**ational **V**ulnerability **D**atabase)](https://nvd.nist.gov/general) - a United States government repository of standards based vulnerability management data represented using the **SCAP** (**S**ecurity **C**ontent **A**utomation **P**rotocol), maintained by [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/).
* All vulnerabilities in the NVD have been assigned a CVE identifier.

üóíÔ∏è The [**`CVE`** (**C**ommon **V**ulnerabilities and **E**xposures)](https://nvd.nist.gov/general/cve-process) program is a public glossary of vulnerabilities identified for specific code bases, software applications or open libraries, maintained by MITRE corporation. A unique **CVE ID** is primarily assigned by MITRE or by **CNAs** (**C**VE **N**umbering **A**uthorities), allowing stakeholders, vendors and researchers to commonly identify unique or new exploits and vulnerabilities.

* [CVE new website](https://www.cve.org/)
* **`E.g.`** - high impact, critical vulnerabilities:
  * [CVE-2014-0160 - Heartbleed](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0160)
  * [CVE-2017-0143 - EternalBlue](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0143)
  * [CVE-2021-44228 - Apache Log4j](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)

| Description                                                                 |
| Severity                                                                    |

üóíÔ∏è The [**`CVSS`** (**CV**E **S**coring **S**ystem)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) is the method used to supply a qualitative measure of severity, consisting of three metric groups: Base, Temporal and Environmental.

* [**Zero-day** exploits](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/zero-day-exploit/) are vulnerabilities exploits not yet found, used or reported by anyone, or discovered by attackers before the vendor's security team has become aware of it. `e.g.`:
  * [CVE-2021-301165 - Kaseya VSA exploited by REvil Ransomware](https://jp.tenable.com/blog/cve-2021-30116-multiple-zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-kaseya-vsa-exploited-to-distribute-ransomware?tns\_redirect=true)
  * [CVE-2020-1472 - Zerologon](https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-microsoft-finalizes-patch-for-zerologon-to-enable-enforcement-mode-by-default)

Scope, impact and usefulness will come down to **business needs**, along with the **risk management** and cybersecurity recommendations.

Risk Management includes **vulnerability management**. By doing a **`VA`** (Vulnerability **A**ssessment), the pentester is going to define, identify, classify and prioritize security deficiencies in computer systems, applications, and network infrastructures. Some procedures to find vulnerabilities are:

* Scanning
* Asset Identification and Research
* Fuzz Testing (input/handling validation)

üóíÔ∏è [**`Nessus`**](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) is a network vulnerability scanning tool. It can be hosted locally and used for Vulnerability Assessment.

### Heartbleed <a href="#heartbleed" id="heartbleed"></a>

* [CVE-2014-0160 - Heartbleed](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0160)

> _The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to d1\_both.c and t1\_lib.c, aka the **Heartbleed** bug._

* [Heartbleed Vulnerability Explanation - by Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/resources/openssl-heartbleed-vulnerability-explained/)
* Show accepted ciphersuites and compressors with [nmap ssl-enum-ciphers](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html) script.

```
nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p <SECURED_PORT> <TARGET>
```

* Detect OpenSSL Heartbleed bug vulnerable servers with [nmap ssl-heartbleed](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-heartbleed.html) script, or with Metasploit enumerate module.

```
nmap -sV --script ssl-heartbleed -p 443 <TARGET>
# Other ports can be used too
```

* [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/) is useful too
  * ‚ùó **always check the exploit behavior before using it**
  * search for `heartbleed`

### Log4J <a href="#log4j" id="log4j"></a>

* [CVE-2021-44228 - Apache Log4j](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)

> _Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects._
